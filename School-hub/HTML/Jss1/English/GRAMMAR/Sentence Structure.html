    <h3>Topic: Sentence Structure</h3>


        <p><strong>3. Sentence Structure</strong></p>
        <p>A sentence is a group of words that express a complete thought. Sentences can be classified based on their structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple Sentence</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Compound Sentence</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Complex Sentence</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Compound-Complex Sentence</strong></li>
        </p>
        </ul>  

        <div id="Present-Tense">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong>A sentence with a subject and a predicate.
                </li>
                <p class="example">Example: She reads books.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Compound Sentence:</strong>A sentence with two or more independent clauses connected by a conjunction.
                </li>
                <p class="example">Example: I wanted to go to the beach, but it started raining.</p>
                <li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong>A sentence with one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.</li>
                <p class="example">Example: Although it was raining, we went outside.</p>
                <li><strong>Compound-Complex Sentence:</strong> A sentence with two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.</li>
                <p class="example">Example: I wanted to go to the beach, but it started raining, so we stayed indoors.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Practice Questions</h3>
        <p>Combine the two sentences into one compound sentence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>"I like soccer. I don't like basketball."</li>
        </ol>
