        <h3>Topic: Organs of speech</h3>
      
        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:</p>
          <li>Identify the major organs of speech.</li>
          <li>Explain how these organs help in producing speech sounds.</li>
          <li>Describe the role of each organ with examples.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Speech is made possible by different parts of the body working together. These parts are called the organs of speech. They help us create and control sounds when we speak. The organs involved in speech are found in the mouth, nose, throat, and lungs.</p>
        
      
        <p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
        <p>Organs of speech are the parts of the human body used to produce sounds. These include the respiratory organs and the vocal apparatus.</p>

            <li class="example"><strong>These organs work together in different ways to create different sounds used in speech.</strong></li>
            <li class="example"><strong>Understanding these organs helps improve pronunciation and speech clarity.
            </strong></li>
          </ul>
